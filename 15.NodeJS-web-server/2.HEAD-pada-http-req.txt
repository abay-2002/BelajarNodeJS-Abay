HEAD Http Method
HEAD is a request method supported by HTTP used by the World Wide Web. The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.

Contoh menggunakan Python:
requests.head(url, params={key: value}, args)

Kesimpulan: 
Method Head akan mengembalikan Head dari request yang diberikan kepada protokol HTTP, tanpa menyertai bagian Body dari hasil request HTTP tersebut.
Atau biasa disebut reponse headers dan isi dari HEAD adalah meta-information.

Advanced with HEAD request
The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
